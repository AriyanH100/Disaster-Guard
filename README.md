CSE360 Project

This is my first project based on Arduino and Sensors. The project is about a device that is "All-in-one Home Security System". With the help of multiple sensors, the device can detect gas leakage, smoke, earthquake, intruder and will notify users through SMS to their phone and a buzzer goes on as well.
